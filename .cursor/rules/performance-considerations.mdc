- **Performance Considerations:**
  - *Optimization Techniques:*
    - Use caching to reduce database load and improve response times.  NestJS provides built-in support for caching using interceptors.
    - Optimize database queries by using indexes, avoiding N+1 queries, and using efficient data retrieval methods.
    - Use connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing database connections.
    - Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
  - *Memory Management:*
    - Avoid memory leaks by properly managing resources and releasing unused objects.
    - Use streams for handling large files or data streams.
    - Use object pooling to reuse frequently created objects.
  - *Rendering Optimization (Server-Side Rendering):*
    - Not directly applicable to NestJS, as it's primarily a backend framework. However, if using SSR, optimize rendering performance by caching rendered pages and using efficient templating engines.
  - *Bundle Size Optimization:*
    - Use tree shaking to remove unused code from the bundle.
    - Minify and compress code to reduce bundle size.
    - Use code splitting to load only the necessary code for each route or module.
  - *Lazy Loading:*
    - Use lazy loading to load modules or features on demand, improving initial load times.
    - Implement code splitting to create smaller bundles that can be loaded independently.
